# ADR-0010: Issue Triage

## Status

## Context
Currently we often encounter the problem of unclear issues and debates often arising in the pull-requests, instead of the issue itself.

## Decision
1. All issues are opened in the backlog and assigned with the triage label
2. Then the issues are looked at by the repository maintainer and then either happends:
   - the triage label is remove and the issue is free to work upon
   - a discussion by the team is started to clear the implementation
4. Then the issue must be clear enough to be implemented and is moved to todo
