# ADR-005: SSO

## Context

Must read: [Keycloak](https://wiki.helpwave.de/doc/keycloak-jedzCcERwF)

Right now, we are on the way to fully commit onto the Keycloak ecosystem. The [current adoption of Keycloak](https://wiki.helpwave.de/doc/keycloak-jedzCcERwF) raises some questions and issues. 

* The user needs to be registered via an API endpoint of `helpwave/services`. This is necessary because of the missing native webhook/event system in Keycloak. With this approach, we can create a group (Organization in helpwave terms) for every user that registered.
* How and where should the frontend lives with the Login/Register UI?\nKeycloak has support for themes via HTML/CSS and FreeMaker. This is not practical for us. If we want to adopt Keycloak theming, we eventually need to create a whole new development cycle (Repositories, Pipelines, Maintainers) for that kind of UI while the rest is fully on React and NextJS.\nAlso, because of the custom registration endpoint, we cannot use the native Keycloak UI for registration.
* Keycloak is about to become a core infrastructure of helpwave. Therefore, we need people in the current team that knows how to operate Keycloak (hardened) in production. Nobody in the current as the knowledge of that. The team can build up such experience, but should either focus more on MVP and business relevant topics.

These questions and issues have led us to re-evaluate Keycloak by maintaining the same outcome as an OIDC provider.

By taking these parameters into account …

* Extensible via hooks
* Custom UI via modern frameworks. React / NextJS preferred.
* Software-as-a-Service. Not managed by us.
* Bonus: Open-Source

… we () can sum up some SaaS solutions to analyze them further:

* Ory (<https://www.ory.sh/>)
* Auth0 by Okta (<https://auth0.com>)

**Ory Network**

* Extensible via hooks:\nYes, via [webhooks](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks).
* Custom UI via modern frameworks. React / NextJS preferred.\nYes, via [Ory Elements](https://github.com/ory/elements/). A component library for React with examples in NextJS. Also, usable in the SaaS offering Ory Network.
* Software-as-a-Service. Not managed by us.\n[Yes.](https://www.ory.sh/pricing/) The Ory Network is their SaaS offering made up of their own open-source software.
* Bonus: Open-Source\n[Yes.](https://github.com/ory) The products are open-source. Not the glue-code for their SaaS offering.
* Pricing:
  * Free development license
  * $29 / per Month billed Monthly

**Auth0**

* Extensible via hooks:\nYes, via [actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).
* Custom UI via modern frameworks. React / NextJS preferred.\nKind of. *Create a custom ui and hitting the right endpoints …*
* Software-as-a-Service. Not managed by us.\n[Yes.](https://auth0.com/pricing) Auth0 is a commonly used SSO provider.
* Bonus: Open-Source\nNo.
* Pricing:
  * Free up to 7,000 active users
  * $23 / per Month

## Decision

Adopt Ory Network instead of Keycloak to not-manage the infrastructure and not be fully vendor locked in.

## Consequences

We already did a lot of integration work for Keycloak. Since the majority of our services already handle Auth via OIDC, not all previous changes are obsolete. There should only be refactoring happening inside the `helpwave/services/user-svc` because this service already talks back to Keycloak for organization management. One change will be to handle the organizations inside the current user-svc.

It becomes a lot easier to manage our infrastructure by obviously not managing the SSO provider.

No migration to the cloud without keeping a return to on-premise in mind. The core services of Ory are open-source.

`helpwave/services` becoming the passive part of authentication by not issuing token led to proper authentication protocol adoption. `helpwave/web` and `helpwave/mobile-app` can just adopt OAuth.

Ory Network is free during development. A production license cost $29 / Month, billed Monthly.
