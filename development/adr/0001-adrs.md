# ADR-0001: ADRs

# Why we are using ADRs

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to document our architectural decisions in a structured manner.

## Decision

We're adapting the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) framework based on this [template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md). This ADR is already written with this template. When we need to change the decision of an ADR in the future, we should modify the ADR when a version control system is in place. If not, the ADR gets superseded.

## Consequences

With ADRs, we have a structured approach to write down architectural decisions and make them accessible for everyone. For people that are not that familiar with ADRs, the process can be intimidating. In that case, the ADR should be written with an experienced user.
