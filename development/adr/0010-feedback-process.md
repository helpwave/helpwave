# ADR-0010: Feedback Process

## Status

## Context
Currently we often encounter the problem of unclear issues and debates often arising in the pull-requests, instead of the issue itself.

## Decision
1. All issues are triaged with a label, meaning they will not be worked upon until a review and quality assurance of the issue has happend
2. After the review and discussion the label is removed an the review free to work upon
