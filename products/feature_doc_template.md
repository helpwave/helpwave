# Feature Name: (A concise and descriptive name for the feature)

## 1. Problem Statement:

    - Briefly describe the current workflow pain point(s) this feature aims to address.
    - Explain how the current process is inefficient, error-prone, or lacks functionality.
    - Quantify the impact of the problem if possible (e.g., increased time spent on tasks, medication errors, scientific references are definately welcome!).

## 2. Proposed Solution:

    - Describe the new feature and how it will address the problem statement.
    - Explain the expected benefits of the feature for both medical staff and patients (e.g., improved workflow efficiency, reduced errors, enhanced patient care).

## 3. User Stories:

    - List several user stories, which are brief descriptions of how different user roles (doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc.) will interact with the feature.
    - Each user story should follow the format: "As a [user role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]." (e.g., "As a doctor, I want to quickly access a patient's medication history so that I can make informed prescribing decisions.")

## 4. User Flow
   A graph that describes the flow of the user throughout the feature should be drawn. Where does the user access the feature? What can he or she do with it? What are possible actions within the process? Now exact definitions of the views are needed (yet).

## 5. Functional Requirements:

    - List all the specific functionalities the feature must have.
    - Be as clear and detailed as possible, considering different use cases.
    - Use layman's terms whenever possible, but include technical terms if necessary.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements:

    Specify any non-functional requirements, such as:
        Security: How will patient data privacy and security be ensured?
        Performance: How fast should the feature respond to user actions? E.g. is stuff like immediate updating necessary?
        Usability: What should the focus be in terms of accessability to use for medical staff with varying levels of technical expertise? Can you anticipate any challenges? Be as detailed as possible and don't just repeat requirements to common design patterns.
        Compatibility: How should the feature integrate with existing hospital systems? What systems? What data is needed from where and where is data output possibly going?

## 7. Success Criteria:

    Define how you will measure the success of the feature.
    This could involve metrics like:
        Reduction in time spent on specific tasks
        Increase in user adoption of the feature
        Decrease in error rates

## 8. Open Questions/Clarifications:

    List any outstanding questions or areas requiring further clarification for the development team.

## 9. Additional Information:

    Include any relevant information not captured in the above sections, such as:
        Screenshots or mockups of the desired interface (if available)
        Examples from other softwares including what they did right and what they did wrong
        References to relevant medical guidelines or protocols
