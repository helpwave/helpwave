# Feature Name: (A concise and descriptive name for the feature)

## 1. Problem Statement:

    - Briefly describe the current workflows' main point(s) this feature aims to address.

## 2. Background and Objective
    - Give some background information and explain how the current process is inefficient, error-prone, or lacks functionality (e.g. anecdotes from clinical practice)
    - Outline the specific objectives and goals of the feature.
    - What do we aim to achieve by implementing this feature?
    - Quantify the impact of the problem if possible (e.g., increased time spent on tasks, medication errors, scientific references are definitely welcome!).

## 3. Proposed Solution:

    - Describe the new feature and how it will address the problem statement.
    - Explain the expected benefits of the feature for both medical staff and patients (e.g., improved workflow efficiency, reduced errors, enhanced patient care).

## 4. User Stories:

    - List several user stories or scenarios, which are brief descriptions of how different user roles (doctors, nurses, pharmacists, administrative staff etc.) will interact with the feature.
    - Each user story should follow the format: "As a [user role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]." (e.g., "As a doctor, I want to quickly access a patients' medication history so that I can make informed prescribing decisions.")

## 5. User Flow
   - A graph that describes the flow of the user throughout the feature should be drawn. Where does the user access the feature? What can he or she do with it? What are possible actions within the process? Now exact definitions of the views are needed (yet).

## 6. Functional Requirements:

    - List all the specific functionalities the feature must have.
    - Be as clear and detailed as possible, considering different use cases.
    - Use common / user friendly terms whenever possible, but include technical ones if necessary.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements:

    - Specify any non-functional requirements such as:
        - Security: How will patient data privacy and security be ensured?
        - Performance: How fast should the feature respond to user actions? E.g. is stuff like immediate updating necessary?
        - Usability: What should the focus be in terms of accessability to use for medical staff with varying levels of technical expertise? Can you anticipate any challenges? Be as detailed as possible and don't just repeat requirements to common design patterns.

## 8. Dependencies and Constraints:
    - Identify any dependencies or constraints, e.g. compatibility with existing hospital systems? What data is needed from where and where is data output possibly going?
        - other features, third-party systems  
        - regulatory requirements, hardware limitations, etc.

## 9. Success Criteria:

    Define how you will measure the success of the feature. What are the conditions under which the feature will be considered complete and satisfactory?
    This could involve metrics like:
        - Reduction in time spent on specific tasks
        - Increase in user adoption of the feature
        - Decrease in error rates
        - Acceptance Criteria

## 10. Potential Risks and Issues:

    Highlight any potential risks or issues that might arise from implementing the feature (e.g. acceptance of staff). 

## 10. Open Questions/Clarifications:

    List any outstanding questions or areas requiring further clarification for the development team.

## 11. Additional Information:

    Include any relevant information not captured in the above sections, such as:
        Screenshots or mockups of the desired interface (if available)
        Examples from other softwares including what they did right and what they did wrong
        References to relevant medical guidelines or protocols
